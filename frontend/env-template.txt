# FRONTEND Environment Variables (for production)
# Copy this to a file called .env in the frontend folder

# 1. REACT_APP_API_URL - Where your backend API is hosted
REACT_APP_API_URL=https://your-backend-domain.com

# ==========================================
# What this variable does:
# ==========================================

# REACT_APP_API_URL
# - Tells the frontend where to send API requests
# - Must start with https:// for production
# - This is the URL where your backend is hosted

# ==========================================
# Important Notes:
# ==========================================

# 1. In React, environment variables must start with REACT_APP_
# 2. The .env file must be in the frontend folder (same level as package.json)
# 3. After changing .env, you need to restart the development server
# 4. For production, this gets built into the app when you run "npm run build"

# ==========================================
# Example values:
# ==========================================

# If your backend is on Heroku:
# REACT_APP_API_URL=https://your-app-name.herokuapp.com

# If your backend is on Railway:
# REACT_APP_API_URL=https://your-app-name.railway.app

# If your backend is on a custom domain:
# REACT_APP_API_URL=https://api.yourdomain.com
